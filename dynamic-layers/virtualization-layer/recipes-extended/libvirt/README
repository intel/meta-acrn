libvirt default connection mode between client(where for example virsh runs) and
server(where libvirtd runs) is tls which requires keys and certificates for
certificate authority, client and server to be properly generated and deployed.
Otherwise, servers and clients cannot be connected.

recipes-extended/libvirt/libvirt/gnutls-help.py is provided to help generate
required keys and certificates.

Usage:
gnutls-help.py [-a|--ca-info] <ca.info> [-b|--server-info] <server.info> [-c|--client-info] <client.info>
If ca.info or server.info or client.info is not provided, a corresponding sample file will be generated.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!! "ip_address" field of server.info must be IP address of the server. !!

Please deploy cacert.pem     to CA and server and client /etc/pki/CA/cacert.pem
Please deploy serverkey.pem  to server /etc/pki/libvirt/private/serverkey.pem
Please deploy servercert.pem to server /etc/pki/libvirt/servercert.pem
Please deploy clientkey.pem  to client /etc/pki/libvirt/private/clientkey.pem
Please deploy clientcert.pem to client /etc/pki/libvirt/clientcert.pem"
